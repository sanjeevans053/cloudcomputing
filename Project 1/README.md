## Data Protection (Part 2)

Data protection in this project is critical, particularly as it involves sensitive information such as personal identifiers from the City of Vancouver Water Permit datasets. The project ensures the security of this data through the following key AWS services:

### AWS Glue & AWS Crawler
- **Sensitive Data Masking**: AWS Glue was used to mask sensitive information in the dataset. This ensures that personal data, such as individual identifiers, is not exposed to unauthorized users. AWS Glueâ€™s automated ETL processes enabled the identification and transformation of personal data fields into anonymized values.
- **Data Crawling for Schema Updates**: AWS Crawler scanned the datasets to automatically detect and update the schema, ensuring that any changes or new datasets were efficiently integrated into the pipeline while maintaining security protocols.

### AWS IAM Roles
- **Access Control with IAM Roles**: Role-based access control was configured using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Only authorized users with specific roles (e.g., data engineers, analysts) were granted access to the data for reading, writing, or processing. Unauthorized access attempts were logged for auditing purposes.

## Data Governance

Effective data governance was key to maintaining control over access, usage, and security of the water permits data. Two critical AWS services were utilized:

### AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- **Controlled User Access**: AWS IAM was employed to regulate access to sensitive data. IAM policies ensured that access was restricted to authorized individuals based on roles, preventing accidental or malicious access by unauthorized users. Users were segmented based on their rolesâ€”data engineers had full access to modify the pipeline, while analysts were granted read-only access.

### AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- **Key Creation and Control**: AWS KMS created and managed encryption keys for the water permits dataset. These encryption keys ensured that data remained confidential and was only accessible by those who were authorized.
